# Book-API

Book-API is, as the name suggest, an API that provides information about books and its genres. This API was developed with the pure intention of learning and is based on the youtube channel [Traversy Media tutorial on NodeJS, Express and  MongoDB APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB9Fq9I5ocs).


## Installation

This API was not deployed and only works on localhost. Therefore, to use it will be necessary to install and setup NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.

>Note: This document is still in development.

### NodeJs and Express setup

```bash
```

### MongoDB and Mongoose setup

```bash
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
